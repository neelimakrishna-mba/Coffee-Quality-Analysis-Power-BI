# ☕ Coffee Quality Analysis

This project analyzes data from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) to identify key factors that influence coffee quality using sensory attributes like Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, and more.

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Goal**: To understand and visualize the impact of various attributes on overall coffee quality.
- **Dataset**: Provided by CQI (Coffee Quality Institute)
- **Tools Used**: Power BI, Excel, Data Cleaning with Power Query

## 📌 Key Insights
- Attributes like **Aroma, Flavor, Acidity, Aftertaste, Balance** significantly influence coffee quality.
- **Top coffee varieties**: Castillo, Redbourbon
- **Top regions**: Ethiopia, Tanzania, Guatemala
- **Top processing methods**: Double Anaerobic Washed, Semi Washed, Honey-Mosto
- Higher altitude regions tend to produce fewer defective beans.

## ⚙️ Data Cleaning & Modelling
- Cleaned and transformed multiple columns (e.g., Altitude, Bag Weight, Grading Date)
- Created relationships between tables for sensory analysis
- Built interactive dashboards and visualizations

## 📈 Visualizations
- Sensory Attributes vs Total Cup Points
- Defects Trends by Country and Processing Method
- Correlation between Attributes and Quality Scores

## 🗂 Files Included
- `Ppt_powerbi_CoffeeQualityAnalysis.pptx`: Presentation of the full analysis
- `README.md`: This file

## 🧠 Conclusion
The combination of bean variety, origin, and processing methods is critical in producing high-quality coffee.
